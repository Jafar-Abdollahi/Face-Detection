# Face-Detection
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene. Face detection, also called facial detection, is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer technology used to find and identify human faces in digital images and video. Face detection technology is often used for surveillance and tracking of people in real time. It is used in various fields including security, biometrics, law enforcement, entertainment and social media.

Face detection uses machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) technology, and plays an important role in face tracking, face analysis and facial recognition. In face analysis, face detection uses facial expressions to identify which parts of an image or video should be focused on to determine age, gender and emotions. In a facial recognition system, face detection data is required to generate a faceprint and match it with other stored faceprints.

Project Overview
Your program will be a typical command-line application, but it’ll offer some impressive capabilities. To accomplish this feat, you’ll first use face detection, or the ability to find faces in an image. Then, you’ll implement face recognition, which is the ability to identify detected faces in an image. To that end, your program will do three primary tasks:

Train a new face recognition model.
Validate the model.
Test the model.
When training, your face recognizer will need to open and read many image files. It’ll also need to know who appears in each one. To accomplish this, you’ll set up a directory structure to give your program information about the data. Specifically, your project directory will contain three data directories:

training/
validation/
output/
You can put images directly into validation/. For training/, you should have images separated by subject into directories with the subject’s name.

Setting your training directory up this way will allow you to give your face recognizer the information that it needs to associate a label—the person pictured—with the underlying image data.
pip install face-recognition
